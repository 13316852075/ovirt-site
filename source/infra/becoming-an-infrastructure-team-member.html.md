# Becoming an Infrastructure team member

This page describes the process for becoming a member of the Infrastructure team (a [maintainer](Becoming a maintainer).)

## Step 1: Get involved

The Infrastructure team primarily uses three resources to get stuff done:

*   [The infra mailing list](http://lists.ovirt.org/mailman/listinfo/infra) for asynchronous communication
*   [oVirt infra trac](https://fedorahosted.org/ovirt/report/1) for issue tracking
*   [ The weekly infra team meeting](Infrastructure team meetings) on IRC for synchronous discussion and review of action items

In general, the team hangs out on the general #oVirt IRC channel on OFTC.

A great first step to getting involved in the Infrastructure team is to introduce yourself on the mailing list, and to start attending the team meetings, if it's possible for you.

In step 1, you should and [ its members](Infrastructure team administrators), the skills we have, the infrastructure we use (like [ git](/Infrastructure git repository) and [ puppet](Infrastructure Puppet details)) and [ the things we have on our agenda to accomplish](Infrastructure team task list). Perhaps you have the time and skills to make suggestions as to how something might be accomplished, or research possible solutions to a problem and make a proposal, to allow other team members to put a solution in place quickly? Perhaps you've noticed something which can be improved, and you would like to add an issue to our Trac instance to help ensure it gets done.

## Step 2: Propose changes - build trust

After a few weeks attending our meetings and/or participating in the mailing list, you will begin to build trust in the team. Patch proposals, and showing good judgement in the changes you propose, will accelerate the trust process.

Because we use virtualized infrastructure, the natural next step is to [ become an administrators of a virtual machine](Adding a new system administrator to a host) to install a new service for the project. As an apprentice administrator, the service will be in incubation for a period of time, during which your administration and promotion of the service will be observed.

After an incubation period, whose length will depend on the quality and quantity of your contributions, and your cultural fit with the team, you will become . Congratulations!
