# Infrastructure

Here is the Infrastructure Team and what we work on for the [oVirt project](http://ovirt.org).

## Mission Statement

The oVirt Infra Team is a volunteer effort to provide community infrastructure services by following the tenets of open source and accepted professional standards of system administrators.

## How we work

This is a [community services infrastructure](http://fedorahosted.org/csi/) team. That means the project infrastructure is maintained to a [professional level](http://mmcgrath.fedorapeople.org/html-single/) by a group of system administrators who are contributing their time. (That time may be contributed as part of their job role, it might be part of a class or workshop, it might be purely voluntary, and so forth.)

People who come to work on this project are *not* already experts, but they might be. You are welcome to learn with us.

To gain access to systems - think of them as keys to doors - we match your skill and the trust you have built with the project. This is part of being a [meritocracy](http://www.ovirt.org/governance/).

As this small team defines process, content will be added to this page.

The main thing is, come [communicate with us](#Communicate) if you have any questions, are interested in learning more, or what to participate in supporting oVirt infrastructure.
