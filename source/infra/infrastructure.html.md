# Infrastructure

Here is the Infrastructure Team and what we work on for the [oVirt project](http://ovirt.org).

## Mission Statement

The oVirt Infra Team is a volunteer effort to provide community infrastructure services by following the tenets of open source and accepted professional standards of system administrators.

## Team

The maintainers of the Infrastructure project are:

*   **Infrastructure Lead:** [David Caro](User:Dcaroest)
*   **Release Manager:** [Sandro Bonazzola](User:Sbonazzo)
*   **CI Leads:** [Eyal Edri](User:Eyal), [David Caro](User:Dcaroest)
*   **Repositories/Build Lead:** [Kiril Nesenko](User:Knesenko)
*   **Gerrit Admins:**[Itamar Heim](User:Iheim), [David Caro](User:Dcaroest)
*   **Puppet and Foreman Lead:** [Ewoud Kohl van Wijngaarden](User:Ekohl), [David Caro](User:Dcaroest)
*   **Mail Servers** [Karsten Wade](User:Quaid)

Read [Becoming an Infrastructure team member](Becoming an Infrastructure team member) for details on joining this project.

Read [Infrastructure team assignments](Infrastructure team assignments) for information about who has access to which parts of the oVirt infrastructure.

### Apprentices and journeyfolk

In addition to the maintainers, there are newer Infrastructure team members who have not yet become maintainers. They are at the very beginning (apprentices) or nearing the end (journeyfolk):

*   [Ohad Basan](User:Obasan)
*   [Alexander Rydekull](User:Rydekull)
*   [Dave Neary](User:Dneary)
*   [Garrett Lesage](User:Garrett)
*   [Brian Proffitt](User:Bproffitt)
*   [Michael Scherer](User:Misc)
*   [Paz Dangur](User:Pdangur)

## How we work

This is a [community services infrastructure](http://fedorahosted.org/csi/) team. That means the project infrastructure is maintained to a [professional level](http://mmcgrath.fedorapeople.org/html-single/) by a group of system administrators who are contributing their time. (That time may be contributed as part of their job role, it might be part of a class or workshop, it might be purely voluntary, and so forth.)

People who come to work on this project are *not* already experts, but they might be. You are welcome to learn with us.

The issue tracker is in a 'trac' instance, [here](https://fedorahosted.org/ovirt/report/1)

To gain access to systems - think of them as keys to doors - we match your skill and the trust you have built with the project. This is part of being a [meritocracy](Governance).

As this small team defines process, content will be added to this page.

The main thing is, come [communicate with us](#Communication) if you have any questions, are interested in learning more, or what to participate in supporting oVirt infrastructure.

### Communication

*   [Mailing list infra@ovirt.org](http://lists.ovirt.org/mailman/listinfo/infra)
*   [IRC channel #ovirt on OFTC](irc://irc.oftc.net/#ovirt)

### Meetings

[ Infrastructure Meetings](Infrastructure_team_meetings)

### Decision process

The Infra team generally follows the principle that if it didn't get discussed on the [mailing list](http://lists.ovirt.org/mailman/listinfo/infra), it didn't really happen.

This means all important or broad-reaching decisions are discussed and decided on the mailing list.

The team uses the same [collaborative decision process](https://blogs.apache.org/comdev/entry/how_apache_projects_use_consensus) that other oVirt teams use, with some lightweight elements added to move along minor votes.

*   +1 is a vote in favor of a proposition
*   -1 is a vote against a proposition, must be accompanied with an explanation of the negative vote.
*   +/-0 is an abstention
*   3 or more +1 votes are required for anything substantial, important, or far-reaching
*   0 or more votes will pass a minor proposition - "If no one objects, it passes."

## Our Architecture

An overview of our technical architecture is available [online](http://monitoring.ovirt.org). If you have a question or comment about our architecture please send an e-mail to **infra@ovirt.org** inbox or stop by the [IRC channel #ovirt on OFTC](irc://irc.oftc.net/#ovirt).

#### oVirt Instances

We have some oVirt instances installed and we use them for our infrastructure. For more information please click [here](Infrastructure oVirt Instances)
