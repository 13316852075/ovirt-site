# LimitationsOnBusinessEntities

## Coding limitations on Business Entities

### Summary

Currently oVirt engine-core and web UI components of oVirt share the same business entities (i.e org.ovirt.engine.core.common.DiskImageBase). As long as there is no separation of business entities between engine-core and web UI , there are some coding limitations (as a result of GWT compilation) which should be addressed by developers defining a new entity.

### List of limitations

*   final members should not be used.

For example:
Use int numberOfVms instead of final int numberOfVms

*   Concrete collection classes should be used.<
    >

For example:<
> Use ArrayList<DiskImage> getImages() instead of List<DiskImage> getImages()<
