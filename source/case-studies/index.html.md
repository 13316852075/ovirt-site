Meet [ Alter Way](Alter Way case study), a French hosting company who deploys oVirt in production for their clients, because "it allowed us to scale up as well as scale out our client workloads".

The main points which swayed their decision? "A very active community, an ambitious technical roadmap with regular releases, and the involvement of companies including Red Hat, Intel, NetApp, Cisco and IBM reassured us that the project would be around for the duration."

[IT Novum](IT_Novum_case_study) is a company that's very focused on delivering open source, so when they decided to build a product and solution set for their customers' datacenter needs, it made sense that oVirt was included.

"RHEV and oVirt are the most advanced KVM management solutions and the only ones we found that were up to par with what VMware provides. Since oVirt is closer to the development process and the community is always helpful in solving problems, we decided to go with oVirt."

"Choosing oVirt has saved us tens of thousands of pounds over proprietary alternatives like VMware. Open source wins the philosophical debate for us." Cost, freedom and a robust consolidated management solution for their KVM virtualization were the main reasons they adopted oVirt.

Dutch software development company [ Nieuwland Geo-Informatie](Nieuwland case study) creates mobile applications that need to tap into a lot of geographic information in a reliable and fast manner. To do this, they needed a virtualization solution that would have high availability at a reasonable cost

“We didn't want VMware. Too expensive. There was already a heavy investment in Linux, so switching to Microsoft HyperV was no option, either; too costly,” Beyond cost, live migration and an outstanding community were two other major reasons Nieuwland decided to go with oVirt.
