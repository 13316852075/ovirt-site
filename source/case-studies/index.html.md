# Case studies

## oVirt user case studies

We are collecting stories of oVirt users and how they are using the software. We have feedback and experiences from hosting companies, small business and educational institutions, and we are always looking to hear from our users!

### Alter Way

Meet [ Alter Way](Alter Way case study), a French hosting company who deploys oVirt in production for their clients, because "it allowed us to scale up as well as scale out our client workloads".

The main points which swayed their decision? "A very active community, an ambitious technical roadmap with regular releases, and the involvement of companies including Red Hat, Intel, NetApp, Cisco and IBM reassured us that the project would be around for the duration."

### Keele University

[ Keele University](Keele University case study) in Stafforshire has a small and dedicated IT staff handling all of the IT demands of the 10,000 students and 2,000 staff. To handle their virtualization needs, they have been using oVirt 3.2 since mid 2013.

"Choosing oVirt has saved us tens of thousands of pounds over proprietary alternatives like VMware. Open source wins the philosophical debate for us." Cost, freedom and a robust consolidated management solution for their KVM virtualization were the main reasons they adopted oVirt.

One feature they are looking forward to rolling out to their users is the oVirt user console. "The user console looks great, because it means we can farm out some of the basic admin tasks to people who want to do things like spin up new VMs."
