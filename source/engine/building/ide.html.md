# IDE

## Using IDE for Ovirt Engine

### Reason

Java IDE Is very much like Vegemite[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegemite);
Some really really like it, some like it as Marmite[2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmite) and some like it as Cenovis[3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenovis).
Others, simply can't stand the thought of it...

As for Java IDE, some like Eclipse, some like Net Beans,
and others can't stand the thought of anything which is not **VI**.

This page is intended for those who would like to use some sort of
a graphical development environmet, which does not requier the use
of 'esc'+':' combination ;)

### Eclipse

*   Recommended due to JBoss integration.
*   Current Eclipse release is Indigo Service Release 1.
    -   Available from <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>
    -   Use the J2EE for developers.
*   For Maven integration add the Sonatype to the installation sites: <http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e/>
