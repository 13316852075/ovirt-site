# Screencasts

We would like to make between 5 and 10 screencasts to show oVirt features (both new and old) before the [ oVirt 3.1 release](Second Release).

Each screencast consists of three phases: Scripting the demoing of the feature, recording the video which shows the feature, and finally adding a voiceover soundtrack to explain what is happening on the screen. Ideally, we can separate each of these stages to spread the load of production.

## Features to show

Priority 1 features:

*   [ Adding a new VM](#Adding_a_new_VM) to an existing oVirt cluster
*   [ Migrating a VM](#Migrating_a_VM) live to a different node
*   [ Cloning](#Cloning) a virtual machine from a template or a snapshot
*   [ Adding storage to a storage domain](#Storage)
*   [ Uploading ISOs or migrating an image using virt-v2v or virt-p2v](#Managing_images)

Priority 2 features (if we have time):

*   [ Gluster integration](#Gluster_integration) - adding and using a GlusterFS storage cluster as a storage domain for oVirt
*   [ Log collector](#Log_collector)
*   [ Backing up and restoring a VM](#Back-up_and_restore)

Each of these features needs a script (the prerequisites, the steps to follow to showcase the feature, and a general guideline to someone adding a voice-over), and someone to record the video - see [recording video](recording video) for how to do this, and finally, someone to add the soundtrack - see [ adding a soundtrack](recording video#Adding_a_soundtrack) for instructions.
