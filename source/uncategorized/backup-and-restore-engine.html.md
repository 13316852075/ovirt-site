This page is intended for collecting information and requirements for backing up and restoring engine.

*   Backup database.
*   Backup certificates that need to be backed up.
*   Identify and backup all the config files for the configured engine.
*   Verify that engine-cleanup cleans the system to the initial state; if not open a corresponding bug per each problem.
