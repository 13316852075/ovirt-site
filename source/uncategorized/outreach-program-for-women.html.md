# Outreach Program for Women

![](Opw-poster-2014-December-March.png "Opw-poster-2014-December-March.png")

oVirt is pleased to announce it will be participating in the Dec 2014-Mar 2015 round of the [Outreach Program for Women (OPW)](//gnome.org/opw/), organized by the [GNOME Foundation](//www.gnome.org/foundation/).

The OPW helps women (cis and trans) and genderqueer get involved in free and open source software. The program provides a supportive community for beginning to contribute any time throughout the year and offers focused internship opportunities twice a year with a number of free software organizations.

## Information for Participants

oVirt, with the help of sponsors, will sponsor internships from December 9, 2014 to March 9, 2015. Any woman who has not previously participated in an Outreach Program for Women or Google Summer of Code internship is welcome to apply, provided she is available for a full-time internship during this time period. This program is open to anyone who was assigned female at birth and anyone who identifies as a woman, genderqueer, genderfluid, or genderfree regardless of gender presentation or assigned sex at birth. Participants must be at least 18 years old at the start date of the internship. Residents or nationals of Iran, Syria, Cuba, Sudan, and North Korea, with whom the GNOME Foundation and Red Hat, Inc., being U.S. organizations, is prohibited by U.S. law from engaging in commerce, are ineligible to participate.

Because the program is intended to help newcomers and contributors who are relatively new to the FOSS community to get more involved, OPW unfortunately can't accept past participants of Outreach Program for Women or Google Summer of Code internships. However, if you qualify for Google Summer of Code, you are more than welcome to apply for it.

Students in the Southern Hemisphere, for whom the program will align with the large portion of their summer break, are especially invited to apply for the program. Because of the full-time requirement, it is recommended that students in the Northern Hemisphere do not apply for this round of the program, but instead start contributing in their spare time to prepare to apply for the next round of the Outreach Program for Women or Google Summer of Code, which will have an application deadline in March 2015 and internship dates from May to August, 2015.

The internships offered are not limited to coding, but include user experience design, graphic design, documentation, web development, marketing, translation and other types of tasks needed to sustain oVirt.

The internship is expected to be a full-time effort, meaning that the participants must be able to spend 40 hours a week on their project. Participants will work remotely from home. Because IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is one of the primary means of communication within oVirt, participants should be present on oVirt's IRC (#ovirt @ OFTC) channel while working. You will also be expected to communicate electronically with other project members via other means, including Bugzilla bug tracker comments, mailing list discussion, blog posts, and personal e-mail. Participants will be expected to blog at least once every two weeks about their work and their blog posts will be included on the site that publishes oVirt blog posts, currently [community.redhat.com](//community.redhat.com), and on the [Women in Free Software Planet](//planeteria.org/wfs).

The GNOME Foundation will be administering the payments of the $5,500 (USD) stipends each participant will receive according to the schedule specified here. In addition, a $500 (USD) travel allowance will be available to the interns.

### How to Apply

The application process is very interactive, and potential interns are expected to work with program mentors even as they are applying. oVirt mentors will work with participants through the application process to help integrate potential interns into the oVirt ecosystem, and continue working with accepted interns as the program progresses.

For more information, visit the [OPW application page](//wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#Application_Process).

## Information for Mentors

1.  Read the [information for mentors](//wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/Admin/InfoForMentors) to be familiar with the expectations for the application process, contracts, and mentoring during the internships.
2.  Send a brief e-mail with an introduction and a subject starting with [INTRODUCTION] to opw-list@gnome.org - the OPW will subscribe you to the list and everyone will know who you are! This is a private list for organizations' coordinators and mentors, where prospective applicants can send their inquiries and applications. The OPW will also subscribe you to the announce list, which is a low-traffic list with important coordination e-mails. While the main list can get busy at times and you are only asked to follow up on e-mails reflecting interest in your organization in the subject, the OPW asks you to keep a close eye on the e-mails sent to the announce list.
3.  (After September 22) sign up as a mentor in the [online application system](//opw.gnome.org/) by following the guide for it.
4.  Start hanging out in #opw and #opw-admin on GIMPNet (irc.gnome.org).
5.  You are welcome to pitch in answering any questions from prospective applicants on the mailing list and the IRC channel.
6.  At any time, please [send the OPW](//wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/Admin#Contact) any feedback about the program, any questions or concerns.
