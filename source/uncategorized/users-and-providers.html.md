# Users and Providers

The oVirt Project is made great by the users who advocate and help in the development of oVirt, by using oVirt in a variety of production environments every day. There are also companies who support us, by investing money, time and development resources into making the project a success, or by donating hosting resources, infrastructure or other community services to ensure we have a great community. This page is dedicated to our users, sponsors, and supporters of oVirt.
