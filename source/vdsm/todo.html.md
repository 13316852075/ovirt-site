# Vdsm TODO

## What Can You Do for Vdsm

### Cleanup

*   `` pylint -E `git ls-files | grep '.py$'` `` makes me cry. A lot of it is "only" about bad style, but we should clear it up and add it to our `make check-local`. We should grow up and pass `pychecker` too.

<!-- -->

*   Improve Vdsm portability. We are very much Fedora-centric at best. Do you want to have Vdsm on your pet distribution? Own that port!

<!-- -->

*   remove all usage of `sudo`, and replace with specific calls to `superVdsm`.

<!-- -->

*   ~~have a logrotate-dependent logrotate.conf that works on Fedora and EL equally well.~~ Our current 'sed' of the EL6-offensive line is good enough.

<!-- -->

*   ~~Configure vdsm to use syslog , but now we need to stop trashing the console~~ -- done by Mark Wu.

<!-- -->

*   ~~Simplify the SysV init script, split most of its code to a "[vdsm-tool](http://gerrit.ovirt.org/295)"~~. Mostly done by Zhou ZhengSheng & Co.

<!-- -->

*   vdsm-tool should assume responsibility on hairy stuff such as [configuring multipath](http://bugzilla.redhat.com/547424), which should not be the business of Vdsm proper.

<!-- -->

*   ~~running vdsClient from the project root dir ends with tears. Some PYTHONPATH games should fix this.~~ done.

<!-- -->

*   ~~require only what we actually use in libvirt, instead of the whole libvirt.rpm.~~ done in Vdsm and mom. <http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/15760/>

<!-- -->

*   vdsm/sampling.py: stop storing self._ifids and _rates in the thread. Rate can sit in the interfaces dict per sample.

<!-- -->

*   avoid putting HWADDR in ifcfg files; things mess up when you replace a NIC.

### Testing

*   ~~write an automatic script that runs on each and every new change to gerrit, and adds an insulting comment if `pyflakes` fails for the new change.~~ Thanks, Robert!

<!-- -->

*   enable coverage during Jenkins tests.

<!-- -->

*   run developer jobs on patches with +2 and V+1.

<!-- -->

*   extend the former script, so that it runs a complete `` `make distcheck && make install` `` in a confined environment (chroot, VM) and reports if there is an error.

<!-- -->

*   run unit and functional tests on reviewed patches (before submission).

<!-- -->

*   add more cases to vmTests.testBuildCmdLine: add more examplary vmParams and their domxml.

<!-- -->

*   make `getAllVolumesTests` more meaningful, not only counting the number of volumes, but testing the image structure.

### Features

*   ~~add hooks for network operations~~ - We now have a before/after setupNetworks hook BUT it receives no parameters! It should receive the nets, bonds and options received by the setupNetworks call and (maybe) the running config before the setupNetworks: <http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/20330/>

<!-- -->

*   Support striping for disk images.

<!-- -->

*   let Vdsm install and run on hosts with no iscsid (report that iscsi is missing to Engine?)

<!-- -->

*   ~~add hooks for device hotplug~~ done.
*   ~~add hooks for device update <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/893576>~~ done.

<!-- -->

*   ~~Add configurable QoS controls on vnics <http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementQoS>~~

<!-- -->

*   ~~Use tmpfile.d when needed.~~

<!-- -->

*   use <interface type='network'>. In the future, this would allow us to migrate a VM from a bridge-based network to funkier types of networks defined in <http://libvirt.org/formatnetwork.html> <http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/9441/>

<!-- -->

*   ~~work in conjunction with Network Manager.~~ works in F20.

<!-- -->

*   report 'bootproto' and bonding_opts not via cfg. <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/987813>

<!-- -->

*   a hook for getVdsCaps (to allow faking network reporting, etc).

<!-- -->

*   On recovery, keep reporting VM until an explicit destroy().

### refactoring

*   In vm.py, libvirtvm.py, clientIF.py there is a mess of prepare\*Path functions (end their respective teardowns), which is too complex to fathom. We have to convert all drive specifications (PDIV,GUID,path) into Drive object at the API entry.

<!-- -->

*   We store VM configuration/state in 3 different places: vm.conf (and its on-disk persistency), vm object and its vm.devices[], and within libvirt. This creates a hell of inconsistency problems. Think of Vdsm crashing right after hotpluggin a new disk. The added disk would not be monitored by Vdsm post-restart and not even by destination vdsm if the VM is migrated.

<!-- -->

*   lvm.PV.guid is devicemapper-owned piece of information; lvm has nothing to do with it, and jumps through [hoops](http://gerrit.ovirt.org/2940) to produce it. Instead, it should be produced by devicemapper and consumed directly by blockSD.

<!-- -->

*   Define an API.VMState "enumeration" and use API.VMState.UP instead of the string 'Up'.

<!-- -->

*   <strike>factor betterPopen and betterThreading out of vdsm. They deserve a pipy review under the names [cPopen](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cpopen) and [pthreading](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pthreading) respectively.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=903246></strike>

*   factor the task framework out of storage. Networking may need it, too.

<!-- -->

*   make storage_mailbox testable; use bytearrays instead of 1MiB strings; use fileUtils.DirectFile instead of forking /bin/dd all the time.

<!-- -->

*   split VM monitoring threads out of core Vdsm. Monitoring process would write to a memory-mapped file the most up to date values, which can be read by Vdsm on demand. This would reduce thread contentions in Vdsm and may simplify the code.

<!-- -->

*   split fenceNode to its own testable module.

### Bugzilla

*   pick one of the [<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?action=wrap&bug_file_loc>=&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_id=&bug_id_type=anyexact&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&component=vdsm&deadlinefrom=&deadlineto=&email1=&email2=&emailtype1=substring&emailtype2=substring&field0-0-0=flagtypes.name&keywords=&keywords_type=allwords&longdesc=&longdesc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard=&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&type0-0-0=notsubstring&value0-0-0=rhel-6.2.0&votes=&=&bug_status=NEW NEW bugs], post a patch to [gerrit](http://gerrit.ovirt.org), and make the bug yours.

<!-- -->

*   undersntand what is the `(deleted)` state of an nfs mount (in /proc/mounts) and deal with it properly in vdsm. See <http://bugzill.redhat.com/807351> .
