## Vdsm Coding Guidelines

*   Vdsm is written in Python (at least mostly), and its coding style should follow the best practices of Python coding, unless otherwise declared.
*   PEP8 is holy
*   API calls and arguments are mixedCased, but new internal modules should use underscore_separated_names.
