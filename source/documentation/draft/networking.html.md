This page is for captuaring Networking related features we would like to have in oVirt going forward:

* ucs integration - sr-iov support - blade harmony - live migration network - ipv6 support - network sla - user defined networks (vlan ranges) - ip allocations (melange in openstack, but forman has support as well) - security groups - permissions on networks - open vSwitch - quantum integration - 'network-manager' architecture - looking into re-designing the engine networking code. - open flow

We'll open a wiki page for each of the above lines.
