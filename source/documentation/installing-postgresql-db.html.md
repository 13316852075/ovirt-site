# Installing

Please take into account that installing and starting a database is a system administration task, so all the commands suggested in this page are to be executed with the `root` user.

**Fedora**

    # yum install -y postgresql-server

**Debian**

    # apt-get install postgresql

Make sure you are using PostgreSQL 8.4.8 or later. Check your version with:

    # psql --version

Note: for earlier PostgreSQL versions, a patch is needed.

# Running the service

#### From PostgreSQL 9

Before starting the database for the first time you need to initialize it using the `postgresql-setup` command with the `initdb` option:

**Fedora**

    # postgresql-setup initdb

Once it is initialized you can start and stop it with the `systemctl` command. For example, to start it:

    # systemctl start postgresql.service

It is recommended to configure the service so that it is automatically started the next time the machine is rebooted:

    # systemctl enable postgresql.service

If the database needs to be recreated from scratch the way to do it is to stop the service, remove the data directory, run the `postgresql-setup` command again, and start the service:

    # systemctl stop postgresql.service
    # rm -rf /var/lib/pgsql/data
    # postgresql-setup initdb
    # systemctl start postgresql.service

**Debian**

The database is automatically initialized, started and configured to start during boot as part of the installation of the package, no need to perform any additional initialization.

To start, stop or restart it use the `/etc/init.d/postgresql` script:

    # /etc/init.d/postgresql start

#### For PostgreSQL 8 or earlier (not recommended)

Before starting the database for the first time you need to initialize it running the `initdb` command with the `postgres` user:

    # su - postgres -c 'initdb -U postgres -D /var/lib/pgsql/data/'

Once it is initialized you can start and stop it with the `service` command. For example, to start it run the following command:

    # service postgresql start

It is recommended to configure the service so that it is automatically started the next time the machine is rebooted:

    # chkconfig postgresql on

# Connecting to the database

Note that this instructions are mostly the same for all distributions, the main difference is the location of the configuration files. For reference see the PostgreSQL documentation [here](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/interactive/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

**Fedora**

Edit the `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf` file and set authentication parameters as follows:

    local   all         all                               peer
    host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32          md5
    host    all         all         ::1/128               md5

After that run `systemctl restart postgresql.service` so that the new settings will take effect.

**Debian**

Edit the `/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf` file and set authentication parameters as follows:

    local   all         all                               peer
    host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32          md5
    host    all         all         ::1/128               md5

After that run `/etc/init.d/postgresql restart` so that the new settings will take effect.

# Connecting from other hosts (optional)

If you want to be able to connect to PostgreSQL from other hosts (i.e. not from localhost only) you will need to change the `listen_addresses` parameter, as the default is to accept local connections only.

**Fedora**

Edit the `/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf` file:

    listen_addresses = '0.0.0.0'

And you will need also to allow access from external hosts in the `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf` file:

    host    all         all         10.35.0.0/16          trust

The `10.35.0.0/16` network address and mask are just an example, make sure you replace it with what you want to give permissions to.

After all these changes restart the PostgreSQL service:

    # systemctl restart postgresql.service

**Debian**

Same as in Fedora, but the location of the files are `/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf` and `/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf`.

After all these changes restart the PostgreSQL service:

    # /etc/init.d/postgresql restart

# External Resources
