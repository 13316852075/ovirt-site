# Community Code of Conduct

We want to keep the oVirt Community a great place to participate, but we need your help to keep it that way. 

The oVirt community is made up of a diverse mix of individuals using and contributing to all aspects of the project from all over the world, and we want to make sure that the community is a safe and friendly place for everyone. 

This code of conduct applies equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance. It applies to all spaces managed by the oVirt project, including IRC, mailing lists, GitHub, Gerrit, oVirt events, and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication. 

While we have contribution guidelines for specific tools, we expect all members of our community to follow these general guidelines and be accountable to the community. This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

## Be Respectful

Our community is defined by the interactions of its members. When people are nice to each other, our community is nice. 

It can be easy to forget, in a disconnected world, that behind the IRC nickname or email address is a person. Please remember that when you communicate with other users, contributors, or anyone outside the community who interacts with us, whether in person or online. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. 

Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. For example, when participating in technical discussions, it's important to stay on topic and keep in mind that the discussion is about ideas, concepts, or processes, not about the people behind them.

## Be Tolerant 

We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person
* Discriminatory jokes and language
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material
* Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally-identifying information ("doxing")
* Personal insults 
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviors
* Repeatedly participating in any of the above behaviors. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

## Resolve Conflicts the Community Way

Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time, and oVirt is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively and with the help of the community and community processes. When our goals differ dramatically, we encourage the creation of alternative implementations, so that the community can test new ideas and contribute to the discussion.

Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect. Asking questions avoids many problems down the road, and so questions are encouraged. Those who are asked questions should be responsive and helpful. However, when asking a question, care must be taken to do so in an appropriate forum.

If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct or if you have any questions about the code of conduct, please email the [oVirt community team](mailto:community@ovirt.org) and describe the situation or your question as clearly and detailed as possible.

## Bug reporting guidelines

*   Before reporting your bug, please [search the bug tracker](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/query.cgi?classificiation=oVirt) to see if it has been reported already. A comment added to an existing bug report is also very useful.
*   To report an issue with oVirt, you first need [an account on our bug tracker](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/createaccount.cgi).
*   Once you have confirmed your email address and are logged in, you can [create a bug against the oVirt product](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=ovirt).
*   If you know which component is causing your problem, then choose that component. Otherwise, if your problem is related to a hypervisor node, choose the "ovirt-node" component. If it is related to the engine, choose "ovirt-engine-core". If you are unsure, choose "ovirt-engine-core", and one of the oVirt developers will reassign the bug for you.
*   When commenting on bugs, please bear in mind that the bug reporter may not know the project as well as possible. If a bug has been reported against the wrong component or product, or if the behaviour observed is expected, please be kind in your comments and explain any changes you make. If you feel the report is not a bug, try to figure out why the expected behaviour is causing problems for the reporter, and suggest a work-around.
*   Above all, be nice. Bug trackers can be emotional places. Separate the person from the problem.

## Code submission guidelines

oVirt uses [Gerrit](http://gerrit.ovirt.org) to manage code submissions.

*   To get started, follow the instructions for [working with oVirt Gerrit](working with oVirt Gerrit)
*   When reviewing a patch, if you are unsure whether the code meets project standards, do not score the patch "-1" or "+1".
*   In comments please be considerate toward the work which the patch submitter has done to submit the patch.
*   For patch submitters: Please familiarise yourself with project coding conventions before submitting a patch. Here are the [Backend Coding Standards](Backend Coding Standards) for all the project parts.

Coding conventions for [ VDSM](Vdsm Developers#Code_Style) are in the wiki, and are included in [ the Maven build process](Building oVirt Engine/IDE) for oVirt Engine.
