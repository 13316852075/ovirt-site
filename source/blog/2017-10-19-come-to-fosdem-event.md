On behalf of oVirt and the Xen Project, we are excited to announce that the call for proposals is now open for the Virtualization & IaaS devroom at the
upcoming [FOSDEM 2018](https://fosdem.org/2018/), to be hosted on February 3 and 4, 2017.

This year will mark FOSDEMâ€™s 18th anniversary as one of the longest-running free and open source software developer events, attracting thousands of
developers and users from all over the world. FOSDEM will be held once again in Brussels, Belgium, on February 3 & 4, 2018.

READMORE

This devroom is a collaborative effort, and is organized by dedicated folks from projects such as OpenStack, Xen Project,, oVirt, QEMU, and
Foreman. We would like to invite all those who are involved in these fields to submit your proposals by December 1st, 2017.

#### About the Devroom

The Virtualization & IaaS devroom will feature session topics such as open source hypervisors and virtual machine managers such as Xen Project, KVM,bhyve, and VirtualBox, and Infrastructure-as-a-Service projects such as Apache CloudStack, OpenStack, oVirt, QEMU, OpenNebula, and Ganeti.

This devroom will host presentations that focus on topics of shared interest, such as KVM; libvirt; shared storage; virtualized networking;
cloud security; clustering and high availability; interfacing with multiple hypervisors; hyperconverged deployments; and scaling across hundreds or
thousands of servers.

Presentations in this devroom will be aimed at developers working on these platforms who are looking to collaborate and improve shared infrastructure
or solve common problems. We seek topics that encourage dialog between projects and continued work post-FOSDEM.

#### Important Dates

- Submission deadline: 01 December 2017
- Acceptance notifications: 14 December 2017
- Final schedule announcement: 21 December 2017
- Devroom: 03 and 04 February 2018 (two days- different rooms)

#### Submit Your Proposal

All submissions must be made via the Pentabarf [event planning site](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM18). If you have not used Pentabarf before, you will need to create an account. If you submitted proposals for FOSDEM in previous years, you can use your existing account.

After creating the account, select Create Event to start the submission process. Make sure to select Virtualization and IaaS devroom from the Track
list. Please fill out all the required fields, and provide a meaningful abstract and description of your proposed session.

#### Submission Guidelines

We expect more proposals than we can possibly accept, so it is vitally important that you submit your proposal on or before the deadline. Late
submissions are unlikely to be considered.

All presentation slots are 45 minutes, with 35 minutes planned for presentations, and 10 minutes for Q&A.

#### Questions?

If you have any questions about this devroom, please send your questions to our [devroom mailing list](https://lists.fosdem.org/listinfo/fosdem). You can also subscribe to the list to receive updates about important dates, session announcements, and to connect with other attendees.

See you all at FOSDEM!
