As part of our efforts to upgrade the ovirt.org website and improve the community experience, we migrated the oVirt website from MediaWiki to Markdown/Middleman. This was a major project that took more than 6 months and involved many contributors from all aspects of the project. 

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all the people who were involved with this migration, from content reviewers to UX designers and Website admins who gave their time and brain power to make this happen.

## What's new?

The new Website is full of improvements and enhancements, check out these highlights:

- Source content is now formatted in Markdown instead of MediaWiki. This means that you can create and edit documentation, blog posts, and feature pages with the same Markdown syntax you know.
- The Website is deployed with Middleman and stored on GitHub. This means that you can make changes to content with the same GitHub contribution workflow that you know (fork, clone, edit, commit, submit pull request). We even have an "Edit this page on GitHub" link at the bottom of every page!
- New layout and design, from breadcrumbs to sidebards and an upgraded landing page.
- Hierarchical content structure. This means that instead of flat Wiki-style files, the deployed Website reflects an organized source repo with content sorted into directories and sub-directories.
- Official oVirt blog! This first post marks the beginning of our new blog, and we welcome contributions. This means that if you solved a problem with oVirt, want to share your oVirt story, or describe a cool integration, you can submit a blog post and we will provide editorial reviews and help publish your posts.

## What's next?

Even though the Website is live, the work is hardly over. We'd like to ask for your help in reviewing content for anything obsolete or outdated, and we'd also like to invite you to submit blog posts or any other content that you wish to share with the oVirt community.

If you find a bug in the Website, such as broken links or missing pages, please report an issue and we will do our best to resolve it as quickly as possible.

For full details on how to add and edit content, as well as how to report issue, see the [main README file](https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-site/blob/master/README.md) of the ovirt-site GitHub repository. 

I hope you will enjoy the new oVirt Website, looking forward to your feedback and contributions!
