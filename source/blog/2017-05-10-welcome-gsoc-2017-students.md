![](/images/wiki/ovirt-gsoc-logo.png) The oVirt project is glad to announce that three talented students will be joining the oVirt community for the 2017 Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program. GSoC is a global 3-month summer program focused on getting more student developers interested in open source software development.
The three students will spend their summer break writing code, learning about open source development, and earning a stipend.

#### Joining us, are:

**Tasdik Rahman** will be working on adding Ansible roles for oVirt-utilities, for easier testing and automated redeployment. His mentor will be Lukas Svaty.

**Shubham Dubey** will be working on configuring backup storage for Ovirt. The idea is to replace the need for a dedicated storage domain for backup and disaster recovery.  Shubham's mentor will be Maor Lipchuk.

**Valentina Makarova** will be working on Implementing oVirt integration tests using Lago - oVirt’s ad-hoc virtual testing environment framework. Her mentor will be Milan Zamazal
