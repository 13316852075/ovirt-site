## What’s new in oVirt 4.2.0?
The **Administration Portal** has been redesigned using [Patternfly](http://www.patternfly.org/), a widely adopted standard in web application design that promotes consistency and usability across IT applications. The result is a more intuitive and user-friendly user interface, featuring improved performance.

**The new Dashboard:**

A new **VM Portal** for non-admin users. Built with performance and ease of use in mind, the new VM portal delivers a more streamlined experience.

A **"High Performance" virtual machine type** has been added to the existing "Server" and "Desktop" types. The new type enables administrators to easily optimize a virtual machine for high performance workloads.

The oVirt **Metrics Store** is a monitoring solution providing complete infrastructure visibility, for decision making and faster issue resolution based on metrics and logs.

oVirt now supports VM connectivity via **software defined networks (SDN)** - implemented by **Open Virtual Network (OVN)**. OVN is automatically deployed to hypervisors, and made available for VM connectivity. Networks can be defined in the UI, over REST, or within the ManageIQ [Gaprindashvili](http://manageiq.org/blog/2017/11/Announcing-Gaprindashvili-Beta2/) release (now in beta).

Support for **Nvidia vGPU**, a technology that enables users to shard a GRID-capable physical GPU into several smaller instances, for GPU-accelerated workloads.

The **ovirt-ansible-roles** set of packages helps users with common administration tasks. All roles can be executed from the command line using Ansible, and some are executed directly from oVirt engine.

**Virt-v2v** now supports Debian/Ubuntu and EL and Windows-based VMs. It is available for VDSM hosts running on EL 7.4, and for oVirt hosts versions 4.0 and above.

oVirt will now use **PostgresSQL 9.5** as its database, for improved performance.

Support is now restored for **Gluster ISO domains** , without the need for a network file system (NFS), previously disabled by Gluster.

An **Affinity Labels** sub tab for clusters, hosts, and VMs in the Administration Portal provides a table view of labels associated with the currently selected entity, as well as add, edit, and delete options.

Support for **LLDP**, enabling oVirt hosts to gather information from their networking interfaces, for improved network configuration. The information can be displayed both in the UI and via an API.

oVirt now features **Gluster 3.12**.

oVirt's hyperconverged solution now enables a **single replica Gluster deployment**.

**Snapshots** can be uploaded and downloaded via the REST API (and the SDKs).

An improved **self-hosted-engine**. It will now connect to all IPs discovered, allowing both higher performance via multiple paths, as well as high availability if a target fails.

A new **self-hosted engine wizard UI**. Among other improvements it now enables users to review and edit their inputs before beginning the deployment process.

A **new driver for Win10**, for seamless remote access to VMs, and improved performance.

**Hosted Engine Ansible-Based Deployment** (in Beta), using “ovirt-hosted-engine-setup  --ansible”, is a new method to deploy a hosted engine. It reduces deployment issues, and will enable users to benefit from future features such as single storage for the hosted engine and other VMs, live storage migration, and improved hosted engine VM editing capabilities.

The **ipa-client package** is now installed on hosts and included in the oVirt Node and in RHV-H. This identity management feature streamlines Cockpit usage, enabling a user to remain logged in while moving from one page to another.

Now administrators can use the Administration Portal to **remove a LUN** from a storage domain. Previously, this functionality was only available via an API.

In addition, there are **stability and performance** improvements in live storage migration and live merge, and **improvements to the host's performance** in high density setups.
