# NUMA and Virtual NUMA

### Summary

The hypervisorâ€™s default policy is to schedule and run the guest on any available resources on the host. As a result, the resources backing a given guest could end up getting spread out across multiple NUMA nodes and over a period of time may get moved around, leading to poor and unpredictable performance inside the guest.

### Current status

*   Initialization
*   Last updated date: 11 Nov 2013

### Detailed Description

*   engine modifications:
    -   Modify the Add/Edit VM dialog, add new tab NUMA
    -   Add two input, one is for NUMA nodeset, another is for Virtual NUMA / topology

*   vsdm modifications:
    -   Add numatune/memory in domain documents
    -   Add cpu/numa/cell in domain documents

When this is set the VM should be marked as non-migratable

### Benefit to oVirt

Allows the users to get better performance from their VM's through using all CPU related memory - including the ones not handled by qemu/kvm. Allows the users to get better performance from their VM's through split virtual NUMA node.
