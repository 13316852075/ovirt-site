# NUMA and Virtual NUMA

### Summary

The hypervisorâ€™s default policy is to schedule and run the guest on any available resources on the host. As a result, the resources backing a given guest could end up getting spread out across multiple NUMA nodes and over a period of time may get moved around, leading to poor and unpredictable performance inside the guest.

### Current status

*   Initialization
*   Last updated date: 13 Dec 2013

### Detailed Description

    -   Add one protperty on Host define NUMA node
    -   Change GUI interface Add/Edit VM dialog with Host tab

When this is set the VM should be marked as non-migratable

### Benefit to oVirt

Allows the users to get better performance from their VM's through using all CPU related memory - including the ones not handled by qemu/kvm. Allows the users to get better performance from their VM's through split virtual NUMA node.
