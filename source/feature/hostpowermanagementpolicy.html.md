# Host Power Management Policy

Bug-Url: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1035238>

This feature should allow the engine to put an empty host to sleep and wake it up again using Wake On LAN when needed. The decision for those actions should be governed by the currently used Cluster policy.
