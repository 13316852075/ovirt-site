# Node

This is the main wiki page for [Node](Node) development.

## Overview

The oVirt Node sub-project is geared toward building a small, robust operating system image. It uses minimal resources while providing the ability to control virtual machines running upon it. A managed node can run in both standalone and mananged modes.

## Technologies Used

*   [libvirt](http://libvirt.org/) for virtual machine and storage management.
*   [collectd](http://collectd.org/) for gathering statistics and monitoring.
*   [Matahari](http://matahari.fedorahosted.org) for host and guest system management.
