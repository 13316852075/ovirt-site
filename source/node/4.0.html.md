# 4.0

Node 4.0 will be a completely different implementation from previous Node implementations.

Node 4 will leverage anaconda for installation, LVM for image management, and cockpit for administration.

## Principles

*   Re-use existing and mature technologies (anaconda, lvm, cockpit)
*   Fix upstream to fit our design
*   Keep it simple
*   Separate areas of responsibility (image vs installation vs image management & upgrade)

## Design

*   Anaconda to install
*   LVM to store and manage images
    -   High-Level management using imgbase (enforcing a specific LVM usage pattern)
*   Leveraging emerging concepts to simplify persistence
    -   Persistent /etc and /var, otherwise read-only or stateless
    -   Combined with the LVM layout this provides a solid upgrade and rollback story
*   Administration through Cockpit
    -   oVirt specific bit's through a cockpit plugin
