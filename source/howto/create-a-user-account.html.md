# How to create a user account

**'You cannot create your own account, you must ask [any other account holder](Special:ListUsers) to do it for you. We are protecting this wiki from spambots and bad actors through self-management. This includes the creation of new accounts.**''

If you need an account, contact one of the [existing account holders](Special:ListUsers), who are fellow participants and contributors.

These instructions are for a person [who already has an account](Special:ListUsers) and wants to grant an account to a new participant. **Use these powers wisely**:

1.  Log in with your user account.
2.  Got to the login page <Special:UserLogin>
3.  Use the link labeled [Create an account](https://www.ovirt.org/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&type=signup), or click this link here
4.  Fill out the account information:
    -   Username
    -   Password - *leave blank*
        -   A randomly generated password is sent to the user's email address
    -   E-mail
    -   Real name

5.  Uncheck "Remember my login on this computer".
6.  Click "by e-mail" to send the new account information directly to the user.

If your browser offers to save the password for this new user, choose no or "Not now".
