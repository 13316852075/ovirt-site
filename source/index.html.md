### Community is Key

oVirt, the first truly open and comprehensive data center virtualization management initiative, provides a venue for user and developer cooperation. The heart of the project is the open source code of oVirt, and the community is governed openly, modeled after the Apache Foundation, Eclipse, LVM, and many other well functioning Linux communities.

Community is not just about software development--there are many excellent ways one can be a part of the community, from joining our helpful mailing lists to meeting us at fun events to sending us a note to tell us how you use the software!

You're encouraged to [ join the oVirt community](Community), and help us bring open source software to virtual datacenters worldwide.

### User Case Study

<div class="text-center">
![](Nwld_logo.png "Nwld_logo.png")

</div>
Dutch software development company [ Nieuwland Geo-Informatie](Nieuwland case study) creates mobile applications that need to tap into a lot of geographic information in a reliable and fast manner. To do this, they needed a virtualization solution that would have high availability at a reasonable cost

“We didn't want VMware. Too expensive. There was already a heavy investment in Linux, so switching to Microsoft HyperV was no option, either; too costly,” Beyond cost, live migration was another other major reason Nieuwland decided to go with oVirt.

It's not just about code; the oVirt community has been a big plus for Nieuwland, which is happy with the level of community support and being able to help others. This give-and take is a big part of why Nieuwland is pleased with oVirt.
